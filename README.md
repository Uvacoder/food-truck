# Food Truck Web App

![](./public/truckee.gif)

## Motivation

I start to like this little project, I decide to take it as far as I can, polishing it up, making it a real-world product in any way that can impress anyone.(anyone includes my mom in case I Fed up). ðŸ¤”

And, I'd like to get feedbacks to make it better.

## Start the project locally

It is a demo app built on top of Next.js, using React to render the data out, and Tailwind for style.

I like to use `bun` for tooling, and of course `npm` works as well, feel free to use your own tools.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

port is at `localhost:3000`

## Todos for the future maybe

- [x] Make a random button, randomize 3 food trucks every time clicks.
- [x] Put res of randomized food truck on top.
- [x] Adding filters for types of lunch.(e.g. tacos or burgers).
- [x] Adding loading state.
- [x] Adding Chinese, Mexican and Italian filters.
- [x] Better UI and UX.
- ~~[] Making the UI more user-friendly. e.g instead of using drop down select filter, it's probably better to use click button.~~
- ~~[] Enable random while disabling filter or vice versa.~~
