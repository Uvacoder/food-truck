## Start the project locally

It is a demo app built on top of Next.js, using React to render the data out, and Tailwind for style.

I like to use `bun` for tooling, and of course `npm` works as well, feel free to use your own tools.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

port is at `localhost:3000`

## Todos for the future maybe

- [x] Make a random button, randomize 3 food trucks every time clicks.
- [x] Put res of randomized food truck on top.
- [x] Adding filters for types of lunch.(e.g. tacos or burgers).
- [x] Adding loading state.
- [x] Adding Chinese, Mexican and Italian filters.
- [x] Better UI and UX.
- ~~[] Making the UI more user-friendly. e.g instead of using drop down select filter, it's probably better to use click button.~~
- ~~[] Enable random while disabling filter or vice versa.~~
- [] Adding backend API.
